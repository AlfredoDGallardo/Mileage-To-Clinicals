# Mileage-To-Clinicals
Excel-based clinical placement analysis that tracks actual vs. optimal placement distance, flags students traveling over 50 miles, and visualizes placement trends across academic terms.

---

## 📊 Overview
This report compares where students were placed for their clinicals versus where they ideally could have been placed based on proximity. It highlights how far each student traveled and identifies those who exceeded the 50-mile threshold — considered unnecessary travel. The report visualizes these trends across multiple academic terms to support clinical placement planning and reduce travel burden on students.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Placement Comparison**
  - Identifies differences between actual assigned clinical locations and the closest possible site for each student.
  - Calculates the miles traveled to determine placement efficiency.

- **Unnecessary Travel Detection**
  - Flags students who traveled over 50 miles to their clinical site.
  - Tallies and calculates the percentage of flagged students per academic term.
  - Applies a visual threshold of 25% to help identify spikes in avoidable travel.

- **Visual Trend Analysis**
  - **Bar + Line Combo Chart**: Displays total clinical students per term (bar) and percentage of students traveling over 50 miles (line), with a red target line at 25%.
  - **Average Miles Traveled Chart**: Shows the average miles students traveled per term (overall vs. in-hub state), overlaid with a 50-mile target benchmark.
  - Helps quickly identify terms where unnecessary travel exceeded acceptable limits.

- **Data Tabs**
  - Clean, structured data including student ZIP, assigned and optimal site, miles traveled, over-50-mile flag, and academic term grouping.

## 📈 Dashboard Summary
The Excel dashboard includes:
- A combined bar/line chart showing:
  - Total students per clinical term
  - Percentage of those traveling over 50 miles
  - A red 25% target line for visual benchmarks
- A line chart showing:
  - Average mileage traveled by all students vs. those placed in their hub state
  - A red 50-mile benchmark line for quick reference

These visuals allow stakeholders to identify placement gaps, unnecessary student travel, and term-over-term improvements or regressions.

## 💼 Business Impact
- Provided clear visibility into avoidable student travel and inefficient placements.
- Enabled leadership to monitor placement performance against a 25% maximum threshold.
- Informed operational decisions that reduce student burden and improve travel equity.
- Created a standard, repeatable dashboard for tracking trends across every 2-month academic term.
